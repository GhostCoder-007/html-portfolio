<h1>About Me — Brendon Nhachi</h1>
<p>I'm Brendon Nhachi, a curious and solutions-driven individual passionate about the intersection of technology and real-world problem-solving. 
With a strong interest in embedded systems and IoT, I enjoy building efficient, reliable systems that improve how we live, move, and connect. 
</p>

<p>I'm currently focused on firmware development, working with microcontrollers like the STM32 and exploring Embedded C to push the boundaries of what small devices can do.
I thrive in environments where innovation meets practical application — whether it's prototyping new ideas, debugging tricky code, or diving deep into the inner workings of a system. 
Beyond the code, I value teamwork, clear communication, and continuous learning. When I'm not immersed in tech, you might find me exploring new music, watching rugby, or experimenting with new ways to automate everyday tasks.

<p>Let’s build the future — one line of code at a time..</p>
